Lab: Getting Started with Kubernetes Engine

Task 1: Confirm that needed APIs are enabled 	
In the GCP Console, hover through the Navigation menu, click APIs & Services. 	
Scroll down in the list of enabled APIs, and confirm that both of these APIs are enabled: 		
Kubernetes Engine API 		
Container Registry API 	
 

2: Start a Kubernetes Engine cluster 	
In GCP console, on the top right toolbar, Activate the Cloud Shel l >-
Click Continue.. 	

Run the command: 
Export MY_ZONE=
Substitute the zone that was provided in this lab credentials		
export MY_ZONE=us-central1-a 	

Start a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubernetes Engine. Name the cluster webfrontend and configure it to run 2 nodes: 		
gcloud container clusters create webfrontend --zone $MY_ZONE --num-nodes 2 	

After the cluster is created, check your installed version of Kubernetes using the kubectl version command: 		
kubectl version 	

View your running nodes in the GCP Console. 

 (Nginx is a popular web server.) 	
kubectl create deploy nginx --image=nginx:1.17 	

View the pod running the nginx container, run the command below...
 kubectl get pods 	
Expose the nginx container to the Internet, run the command below... 		
kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type LoadBalancer 	
View the new service, run the command below... 		
kubectl get services 	

Scale up the number of pods running on your service using the command below... 
kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas 3 	

Confirm that Kubernetes has updated the number of pods using the command below... 		
kubectl get pods 	

Confirm that your external IP address has not changed by running this command... 		kubectl get services
